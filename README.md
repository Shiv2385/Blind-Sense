# Blind-Sense : Real-time object detection and audio assistance for visually impaired.

## Overview
**Blind Sense: Real-Time Object Detection and Audio Assistance for Visually Impaired** is an AI-powered assistive system designed to support visually impaired individuals by providing real-time audio feedback about their indoor environment. Utilizing an ESP32 camera module and the YOLO object detection algorithm, the system identifies and announces objects in the user's surroundings.


## Features

- **Voice-Controlled Interface**: Enables hands-free interaction via voice commands.
- **Object Detection**: Detects objects in the camera feed.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies known individuals in real-time.
- **Add New Face**: Allows registering new faces to the system.
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Offers a voice-driven AI chatbot for queries.
- **Text Recognition (OCR)**: Reads out text detected in the environment.
- **Object Search**: Locates a specific object within the camera frame.
- **Navigation**: Assists in basic navigation with directional support.
